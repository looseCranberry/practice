* Pseudo code to find denominators

User inputs a number
User inputs another number
Init a counter at one
Check division against number 1
No remainder?
	Push as denominator
Check division against number 2
No remainder?
	Keep as denominator
Otherwise pop off the stack
Increment counter
Continue

The purpose of pseudocode is to identify and create a roadmap
of dealing with problems. In the above example we have a very
simple problem--find the denominators of two numbers. We can
then break that problem down into multiple _subproblems_ as we
have listed above. Now we have manageable issues to deal with
one by one.
